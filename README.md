**Pocket Pickers** is an award-winning stealth-action platformer developed in Unity as a senior capstone project at CSUMB.  
Play as a bank robber trapped in hell, breaking into the underworld's vault to reclaim your sins and escape your eternal punishment.

> 🏆 **CSUMB Fall 2024 Capstone Project Award:** 
> *Best Computer Design & Computer Science Integrated Project*

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

You'll use a magic playing card that can be thrown, bounced off walls, and teleported to — the cornerstone of both movement and strategy.

- 🎯 **Throw & teleport** to a magical card to traverse and outwit enemies
- 😈 **Avoid sinfully violent behavior** — attacking enemies makes the game harder
- 🔥 **Collect your sins** and escape Hell’s vault, but beware: the more you carry, the stronger the guards become
- 💀 **Multiple runs encouraged** — make strategic trips to reclaim your soul one piece at a time

A careful balance of stealth, mobility, and risk defines your path to redemption.

## 🎯 Objective

Your mission is to locate and collect glowing **sin objects** hidden throughout each level and return them to the exit.  
Every sin increases difficulty — enemies get faster, more aware, and your stealth options narrow. Plan carefully:

- 🏃‍♂️ Go for a few sins at a time to play it safe  
- 🪙 Or risk a large trip to save time... but raise the stakes

Master teleportation, avoid unnecessary violence, and escape Hell!
